# AddiVortes: Bayesian Additive Voronoi Tessellations for Machine Learning

AddiVortes implements Bayesian Additive Voronoi Tessellation models for
machine learning regression and non-parametric statistical modeling.
This package provides a flexible alternative to BART (Bayesian Additive
Regression Trees), using Voronoi tessellations instead of trees for
spatial partitioning. The method is particularly effective for spatial
data analysis, complex function approximation, and Bayesian regression
modeling.

## Details

Key features include:

- Machine learning regression with Bayesian inference

- Alternative to BART using Voronoi tessellations

- Spatial data analysis and modeling

- Non-parametric regression capabilities

- Complex function approximation

- Uncertainty quantification through posterior inference
